A home autmation system using the Raspberry Pi as the control hub
(although, in theory, any Linux device could be used).

At this point this is mostly experimental. See labNotebook.org for
details of what works and what doesn't and what I'm thinking of for
further work. This file is not a roadmap, it is a note on the results
of experiments conducted or planned.

Over time I expect a roadmap will appear in the issue tracker, but for
now I'm still experimenting.

# Status

  * We have a Django web application to provide the control interface
  * It turns Philips Hue lights on and off
  * At present the configuration of the lights is hard coded, we need to make them configurable

# Contributions

Contributions very welcome. This project is run as a meritocracy and
operates under what is commonly known as "The Apache Way" - in short
if you do good stuff you'll get commit priveleges.

We define "good stuff" as any contribution of vale, that includes
ideas, testing, feedback, documentation and more. Of course code is
important too!

Use the issue tracker for discussions and issue pull requests for
code. I look forward to working with you.
