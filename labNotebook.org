python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

* Using

* Development Log
** Iteration 1
*** DONE Create a log database file

The application should log all activity in the application to a database file

python manage.py startapp log

python manage.py makemigrations log

python manage.py migrate

*** DONE Create an admin user

python manage.py createsuperuser
Username: admin
Email: ross@gardler.org
Password: Usual 3G one in simple form

*** DONE Create a basic admin interface for the log database
*** DONE Create a user view with a single button that logs a message in the debug log whenever it is pressed

This is the first view that should be tested on the Pi itself.

**** DONE created a hello world view
**** DONE Add the button

A button will automatically be created for each of the entries in the
Log table.

**** TODO Add a button to turn on the Office lights



**** DONE find a python library for Phillips Hue

Will use https://github.com/allanbunch/beautifulhue

See experiments/pyhue (aborted) and experiments/beautifulhue

** Iteration 2
*** TODO Make the button functionality pluggable
At present the buttons are generated from the entries in the Log table
and functionality is hard coded into the Log application. We should
make this pluggable so that we can drop in a new "feature" and it will
appear in the interface.

** Iteration 3
*** TODO Refactor Hue bridge logic

Hue logic for connecting to the Bridge is in homebacking/views.py is
sould be in a controller class in the hue app.

We also have two bridge connections one in homebaking.views and one in hue.views

*** TODO Hue app is tightly coupled to homebaking app via hue.views.takeAction
