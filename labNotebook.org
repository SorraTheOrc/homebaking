(e.g. "America/Los_Angeles")

python manage.py migrate

* Running

At present we only run in development mode. This is not secure and
should not be used in a production home (i.e. exposed outside the home network)

python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

* Using

* Development Log
** Iteration 1
** DONE Create a log database file

The application should log all activity in the application to a database file

python manage.py startapp log

python manage.py makemigrations log

python manage.py migrate

** DONE Create an admin user

python manage.py createsuperuser
Username: admin
Email: ross@gardler.org
Password: Usual 3G one in simple form

** DONE Create a basic admin interface for the log database
** TODO Create a user view with a single button that logs a message in the debug log whenever it is pressed

This is the first view that should be tested on the Pi itself.

*** DONE created a hello world view
*** DONE Add the button

A button will automatically be created for each of the entries in the
Log table.

[master e47e868] Add a button for each of the entries in the Log table
 5 files changed, 30 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 log/templates/log/index.html
 create mode 100644 log/urls.py

*** DONE add a log action to the button

When the button is clicked the appropriate action is logged in the Log
table and reported on the status line.

** TODO Add a feature to turn Great Room lights on

** TODO Find a suitable Python library for the Phillips Hue

** Iteration 2
** TODO Make the button functionality pluggable
At present the buttons are generated from the entries in the Log table
and functionality is hard coded into the Log application. We should
make this pluggable so that we can drop in a new "feature" and it will
appear in the interface.
